The following is a skeleton of default configuration files to
facilitate the use of Per Vices SDR products.

This skeleton is intended for you to modify some configuration 
files and then be able to copy it over to the host machine, to
automate some common configuration tasks, such as setting MTU
settings, or network interfaces. 

You may NOT require all the files. For example, you will only
need to copy one of the default interface configurations, 
depending on whether you are using netctl or network manager.

Additionally, you SHALL have to modify the configuration files 
to get them working properly. In particular;

common-conf/etc/conf.d/setmtu
	Change the contents of this file to reflect the adapter 
	names.

common-conf/etc/netctl
	ARCHLINUX: If you use netctl, you can modify this 
	directory to reflect adapter names.

common-conf/etc/network/interfaces
	UBUNTU: If you use the network interfaces file, you can 
	modify this file to reflect adapter names.

Once you copy over the setmtu utility, you should be able to set 
the correct MTU by using a systemd script;

systemctl enable setmtu@<adapter_name>

Provided you correctly specified the adapters in the 
/etc/conf.d/setmtu file, it should work next boot.
